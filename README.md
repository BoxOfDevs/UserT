Description
===========
ImagicalMine has many good plugins, but currently it does not have any TPA plugins. As a few people had asked for some, we finally decided to start on one and quickly coded it up to standard. So here it is, UserTP, the plugin that adds TPA-like features to your game.

Commands
=========
All the commands currently in UserTP:

    - /utp invite|ask|accept|decline <player> : Let's a user invite another player to them, ask to teleport to another player, and then accept or deny these requests

    - /uptall here|player|<x> <y> <z> : Let's you teleport all players either to you, to another player, or to specified XYZ coordinates

Permissions
============
All the permissions currently in UserTP:

    - usertp : UserTP Universal Permission, Default: False

        â€¢ usertp.command : UserTP Commands Universal Permission, Default: False

            - usertp.command.main : Allows /utp, Default: True

            - usertp.command.all : Allows /utpall, Default: OP
